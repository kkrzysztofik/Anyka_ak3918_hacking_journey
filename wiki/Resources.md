## Quick Start SD Card Hack

This hack runs only when the SD card is inserted leaving the camera unmodified. It is beginner friendly, and requires zero coding/terminal skills. See more in the [SD card factory documentation](https://github.com/kkrzysztofik/Anyka_ak3918_hacking_journey/tree/main/SD_card_contents/Factory)

It is unlikely that this can cause any harm to your camera as the system remains original, but no matter how small the risk it is never zero (unless you have the exact same camera). Try any of these hacks at your own risk.

The SD card hack is a safe way to test compatibility with the camera and to see if all features are working.
