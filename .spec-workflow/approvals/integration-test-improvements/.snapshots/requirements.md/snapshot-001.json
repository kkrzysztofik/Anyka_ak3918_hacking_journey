This enhancement will transform the current test suite into a professional-grade framework that ensures ONVIF Profile S & T compliance, provides reliable performance metrics, and maintains code quality standards suitable for production use.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature supports the project's core goals of delivering a robust, compliant ONVIF implementation by:\r\n- Ensuring comprehensive validation of ONVIF Profile S & T compliance requirements\r\n- Providing automated regression detection for performance and functionality\r\n- Establishing maintainable test patterns that support long-term development\r\n- Reducing maintenance overhead through elimination of code duplication\r\n- Enabling confident deployment through reliable test coverage\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Test Framework Restructuring\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer working on the ONVIF implementation, I want a well-organized test framework with clear categorization, so that I can efficiently run specific test types and understand test purpose without confusion.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the test framework is restructured THEN the system SHALL organize tests into separate directories: unit/, integration/, performance/, and compliance/\r\n2. WHEN tests are categorized THEN the system SHALL provide pytest markers for selective test execution by category\r\n3. WHEN fixture files are consolidated THEN the system SHALL eliminate all code duplication between conftest.py and fixtures.py\r\n4. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% backward compatibility for existing test execution\r\n5. WHEN directory validation is run THEN the system SHALL confirm all required directories and __init__.py files exist\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Code Quality and Standards\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a maintainer of the test suite, I want automated code quality enforcement and consistent coding standards, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows industry best practices.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN code quality tools are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce Pylint score ≥8.0, Black formatting, and 90% test coverage minimum\r\n2. WHEN pre-commit hooks are installed THEN the system SHALL automatically validate code quality before commits\r\n3. WHEN quality checks are run THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports for coverage, linting, and formatting issues\r\n4. WHEN documentation standards are applied THEN the system SHALL require docstrings for all public functions with proper format\r\n5. WHEN validation scripts are executed THEN the system SHALL confirm all quality gates pass\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: ONVIF Compliance Validation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive ONVIF specification compliance validation, so that I can be confident the implementation will work with standard ONVIF clients and meet certification requirements.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN Profile S compliance is tested THEN the system SHALL validate all 13 mandatory features including user authentication, capabilities, discovery, network configuration, and system datetime\r\n2. WHEN Profile T compliance is tested THEN the system SHALL validate all 22 mandatory features including enhanced video streaming, PTZ support, and imaging service requirements\r\n3. WHEN SOAP responses are validated THEN the system SHALL verify proper envelope structure, namespace declarations, and operation-specific response formats\r\n4. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL produce detailed HTML and JSON reports showing feature-by-feature compliance status\r\n5. WHEN conditional features are tested THEN the system SHALL properly identify applicable vs non-applicable features and validate accordingly\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Enhanced Performance Testing\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want comprehensive performance metrics with statistical analysis and regression detection, so that I can monitor system performance over time and detect regressions before they impact production.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN the system SHALL collect response times, CPU usage, memory usage, and success rates with statistical analysis including mean, median, standard deviation, and 95th percentile\r\n2. WHEN concurrent load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL validate system behavior under 50 concurrent operations with 10 worker threads\r\n3. WHEN performance baselines are managed THEN the system SHALL save/load baseline metrics and detect regressions with configurable tolerance thresholds\r\n4. WHEN throughput is measured THEN the system SHALL calculate and validate operations per second over sustained test periods\r\n5. WHEN memory stability is tested THEN the system SHALL monitor memory usage during extended operation periods and detect memory leaks\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Device Service Test Enhancement\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want comprehensive device service tests with zero code duplication and complete operation coverage, so that all ONVIF device functionality is thoroughly validated.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN device fixtures are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide centralized, reusable fixtures with zero duplication across test files\r\n2. WHEN device operations are tested THEN the system SHALL cover all required operations: GetDeviceInformation, GetCapabilities, GetSystemDateAndTime, GetServices, plus missing operations SetSystemDateAndTime, CreateUsers/DeleteUsers, SetNTP, SetHostname, SetNetworkInterfaces\r\n3. WHEN SOAP validation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate request format, response structure, and field presence/types for each operation\r\n4. WHEN error handling is tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper SOAP fault responses for invalid operations and malformed requests\r\n5. WHEN performance integration is implemented THEN the system SHALL include device-specific performance tests with statistical analysis\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each test file, fixture, and utility should have a single, well-defined purpose\r\n- **Modular Design**: Test utilities, fixtures, and helpers should be isolated and reusable across different test categories\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between test modules and provide clear separation of concerns\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between test utilities, fixtures, and actual test implementations\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Test suite execution time shall not exceed 10 minutes for complete run (all categories)\r\n- Individual test methods shall complete within 30 seconds maximum\r\n- Performance tests shall provide statistical significance with minimum 20 iterations\r\n- Concurrent tests shall validate system stability under realistic load conditions\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Test credentials and sensitive data shall be externalized to configuration files\r\n- Test utilities shall validate input parameters and prevent injection attacks\r\n- Authentication testing shall verify both positive and negative scenarios\r\n- Compliance tests shall validate security features are properly implemented\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Test suite shall achieve >99% reliability with no flaky tests\r\n- All tests shall be independent with no shared state dependencies\r\n- Test data setup and teardown shall be fully automated\r\n- Error handling shall provide clear diagnostic information for failures\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Test execution shall support selective running by category, service, or compliance level\r\n- Test reports shall be human-readable with clear success/failure indicators\r\n- Configuration shall be centralized and environment-specific\r\n- Documentation shall provide clear setup and usage instructions for new developers",
